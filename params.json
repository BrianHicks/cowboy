{"body":"[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/BrianHicks/cowboy.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BrianHicks/cowboy)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nIn the **future** you'll be able to install from PyPI. [Progress on\r\nrelease.](https://github.com/BrianHicks/cowboy/issues?milestone=1&state=open)\r\nFor now, do this to get the non-production-ready code on your machine:\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/BrianHicks/cowboy.git\r\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n    nosetests\r\n\r\n## How to do stuff with Cowboy\r\n\r\nMake a range:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport datetime\r\nfrom cowboy import DateRange\r\n\r\nfirst_quarter = DateRange(\r\n    start=datetime(2012, 1, 1),\r\n    end=datetime(2012, 3, 31)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee if an arbitrary value is within the range:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfirst_quarter.contains(datetime(2012, 2, 1)) # True\r\n```\r\n\r\nStep through all the values in the range:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom cowboy import NumberRange\r\n\r\none_through_ten = NumberRange(1, 10)\r\n\r\none_through_ten.steps(resolution=1) # Generator yielding [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Things that are done\r\n\r\nRange (and DateRange, specifically) object, supporting `contains` and `steps`\r\n\r\n### Things I'd like to do\r\n\r\nadding and subtracting, length, special before and after\r\n","tagline":"It works on ranges.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
